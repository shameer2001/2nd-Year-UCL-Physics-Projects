### Final Assignment: The-infinite-unsquare-potential
Solving the Schr√∂dinger equation for various potentials in Python3. Solutions included infinite square well eigenvalues, ground state energy and higher energies.

Also, ground state and higher energies were found for finite-square well, harmonic potential and an arbitrary potential.
